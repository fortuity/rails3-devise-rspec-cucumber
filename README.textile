h1. Rails 3 + Devise + RSpec + Cucumber

This is an example application for Rails 3.0 or Rails 3.1 that shows how to use "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise with "RSpec":http://rspec.info/ and "Cucumber":http://cukes.info/. Devise gives you ready-made authentication and user management. RSpec is a popular alternative to the Test::Unit testing framework. Cucumber is often used with RSpec for Behaviour Driven Development. Best of all, there's a "detailed tutorial":https://github.com/railsapps/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber/wiki/Tutorial (walk-through) to show how it's built.
